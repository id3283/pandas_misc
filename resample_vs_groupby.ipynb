    "The fundamental difference is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`resample()`** is for **frequency conversion**. It aggregates data over fixed, continuous time intervals (e.g., from seconds to minutes, days to months). It is \"time-aware\" and can create new time bins that didn't exist in the original data (e.g., upsampling or filling gaps).  `resample()` is based on `groupby()` combined with fill operations.\n",
    "*   **`groupby()`** is for **categorical grouping**. It groups rows based on identical values in a column. When used with time data, it's not grouping by a *frequency*, but rather by a *property* or *label* derived from the timestamp, such as the hour of the day, the day of the week, or the month number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important differences:\n",
    " * `resample` can interpolate missing values\n",
    " * `groupby` can elide missing values (well... supposedly)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You would want to use `groupby()` on time series data instead of `resample()` in scenarios like:\n",
    "* Find the average value for each day of the week over a multi-week period.\n",
    "* Group by time and another category\n",

    "### 1. Grouping by Cyclical Time Features (Ignoring the Date)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common use case. You want to analyze patterns that repeat over time cycles, irrespective of the specific date. For example, you want to compare the average activity across all Mondays vs. all Tuesdays, or see which hour of the day is busiest across your entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "`resample` cannot do this. `resample('D')` would give you one value for each day. `groupby()` lets you aggregate all data points that share the same time property.\n",

    "You often need to create groups based on a combination of a time period *and* another categorical variable.
